      Hello and thanks for stopping by! I hope you enjoy taking a look at this small fraction of photos that I've taken over the years. I bought my first point-and-shoot camera back in 2004 and I've been hooked ever since. Photography for me, is a way to slow down life just a bit, and live more in the present.

      My intent with this site is to get my long-dormant photo collection some much needed attention and hopefully inspire some of you to share your work as well. I never was very good at reaching a significant audience through social media, and nowadays it doesn't seem as if many of those platforms are even meant for photography anyways. This is a home for my images where I can show them in higher quality, not have to crop due to an unusual aspect ratio and where I'm not worried about some tech company randomly shutting down the site because of shifting corporate priorities. Feel free to reach out using one of my social links below. Take care.
